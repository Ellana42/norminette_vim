# Norminette.vim

Minimalistic vim plugin for 42 students. It highlights the lines not in line with the school norm.

If you have the norminette installed, you should be able to use the plugin just by sourcing norminette.vim in your vimrc, or even appending the code to your vimrc.

# Requirements

- the norminette program
- Vim 8

# Next steps

- Improve error message display and disparition
- Use the sign column to show which lines contain norm errors instead of a hightlight
- Add a status line widget indicating norm status
